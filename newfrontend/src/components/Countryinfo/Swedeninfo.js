            Sweden (Swedish: Sverige [ˈsvæ̌rjɛ] (About this soundlisten)), officially the Kingdom of 
            Sweden (Swedish: Konungariket Sverige [ˈkôːnɵŋaˌriːkɛt ˈsvæ̌rjɛ] (About this soundlisten)), 
            is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe.[18] It borders Norway to the west and north, 
            Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across

            largest country in Europe by area. The capital city is Stockholm. Sweden has a total 
            population of 10.3 million[9] of which 2.6 million have a foreign background.[19] Persons 
            who have foreign backgrounds are defined as persons who are foreign born, or born in Sweden 
            with foreign born parents.[20] It has a low population density of 22 inhabitants per square 
            kilometre (57/sq mi) and the highest urban concentration is in the central and southern half 
            of the country.
