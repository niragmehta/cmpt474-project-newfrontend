            The Netherlands (Dutch: Nederland [ˈneːdərlɑnt] (About this soundlisten); Papiamentu: 
            Hulanda; West Frisian: Nederlân), informally Holland,[12] is a country in Western Europe 
            with some overseas territories in the Caribbean. In Europe, it consists of 12 provinces 
            that border Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, 
            with maritime borders in the North Sea with those countries and the United Kingdom.[13] 
            Together with the Caribbean Netherlands, consisting of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba, 
            it forms a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The country's official 
            language is Dutch, with English and Papiamentu as secondary official languages in the 
            Caribbean Netherlands, and West Frisian as a secondary official language in the province 
            of Friesland.[1] Dutch Low Saxon and Limburgish are recognised regional languages (spoken 
            in the east and southeast respectively), while Sinte Romani and Yiddish are recognised 
            non-territorial languages.[1]
